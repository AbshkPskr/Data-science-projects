## EDWISOR Data science career path projects.

This repository contains two data science project completed for the course currriculum of Edwisor data science career path.<br><br>

- ### 1. Bike Rental
  Data analysis is done to gain the insights and cutomer behaviour towards renting bike according to the given conditions. A machine learning model is created to predict the number of bikes going on rent using previous two years data. Data includes features like season, weather condition, humidity, windspeed etc, an analysis on these factors is done to indicate the relation with the outcome. This helps company to maintain the inventory, required in different situations and assist to maximize the profit. It is a supervised machine learning regression problem as we have to predict the number of bikes which is a continuous feature. <br><br>

- ### 2. Employee Absenteeism
  This project targets the study of underlying factors that causes employees absenteeism. Factors like reason for absence, chronic diseases, money spend in commute, distance between office and home, number of children etc are used to predict the absenteeism behaviour of an employee. Although the target feature in this problem is a continous variable but binning technique is used to convert it to a supervised machine learning classification problem. This study helps the organization to better manage the man power and aids in improving the hiring process.
